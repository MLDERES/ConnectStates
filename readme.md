# Connect Four States
This is a game to play on road trips.  You can use license plates, states you've visited, meeting people from different places, or anything else you'd like.  The idea is to get four states (or 5 or 6!) that are all connected to each other.  For instance, identify license plates which are in connected states that each share at least one border.
